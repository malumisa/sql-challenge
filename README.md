# sql-challenge

## Background
### 
In this challenge I have to demonstrate my knowledge in SQL as a newly hired data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). The first major task is to do a research project on employees of the company from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. In this project, I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, and imported the CSV files into a SQL database and then answered questions about the data. This task is composed of data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Process
